By using 'extern', you are telling the compiler that whatever follows it will be found (non-static) 
at link time, don't reserve anything for it since it will be encountered later.
It's very useful if you need to share some global between modules and don't want to put / initialize it in a header.
Technically, every function in a library public header is 'extern', however labeling them as such has very 
little to no benefit, depending on the compiler. Most compilers can figure that out on their own*/
